Mapping Pressure From Particles To Nodes:
        The pressure is mapped from the particles to nodes in solvers which 
        solve pressure at nodes. This is different from the classical explicit 
        MPM in which the pressure is calculated at particles, thus there is no
        need to map pressure from particles to the nodes. However, in some
        methods, such as Chorin's projection method for solving incompressible
        Navier-Stokes equations, the pressure is solved at the nodes. In these
        solvers, the pressure is required at the nodes. 
        In this MPM program, there is a fuction for mapping pressure from the 
        particles to the grid nodes. This function executes as follows:

        M_i * p_i = sum (m_p * p_p * N_i(x_p));
              p_i = M_i * p_i / M_i;

Defining Free Surface Nodes and Elements:  
        This MPM program includes an algorithm for defining free surface nodes
        and elements. This function is useful when there are special boundary
        conditions at free surface nodes and elements. For an example, the 
        pressure at a free surface is usually zero. This free surface pressure 
        boundary condition is essential in Chorin's projection method for
        incompressible NS equations.
        The algorithm containes two criteria to define free surface nodes.
            1. First, elements in which free surface particles are located
               are identified.
            2. Secondly, in these free surface elements, free surface nodes are
               identified using particle density aroung each node. If the 
               calculated particle density is less than a cutoff value, the 
               node is set as a free node.
